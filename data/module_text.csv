eco_forecast,"Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Forecast uncertainty is derived from multiple sources, including model parameters, driver data, among others. Knowing the uncertainty associated with a forecast enables forecast users to evaluate the forecast and make more informed decisions. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle, in which they make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; and use the model to make a forecast of future conditions and quantify forecast uncertainty. There are a number of approaches that forecasters can use to reduce uncertainty, which will be explored in this module."
this_module,"This module will guide you through an exploration of the  sources of uncertainty within an ecological forecast, how uncertainty can be quantified, and steps which can be taken to reduce the uncertainty in a forecast you develop for an ecological site of your choice."
goal,Develop a forecast with fully quantified sources of uncertainty and identified ways in which this uncertainty can be minimized.
EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."
Macro,"Macrosystems ecology is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales. Our interdisciplinary team is developing flexible classroom modules that introduce undergraduate students to the core concepts of macrosystems ecology and ecological forecasting, supported by the NSF Macrosystems Biology program grant 1926050."

how_forecast,This module will guide you through the key steps within the forecast cycle and explain how we create ecological forecasts.
eco_forecast1,An ecological forecast is a prediction of future environmental conditions with uncertainty.
eco_forecast2,"An ecological forecast predicts changes in ecosystems in response to environmental drivers such as weather conditions, pollution, or habitat change. It also provides information about how people, economies, and communities may be affected. Local authorities and members of the public use these early warnings to make decisions to protect the health and well-being of a particular area."

workflow1,"After the instructor completes the PowerPoint presentation, students will launch the Shiny app. Students work in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Introduction"", ""Exploration"", ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives embedded within each tab. Within each activity tab, there are individual objectives which must be completed before moving onto the next one (e.g., within Activity A, Objective 1 is ""Select and view site"")."
workflow2,There are questions in green text boxes embedded throughout the Shiny app which students can  input answers into.
workflow3,"When all of the objectives are completed and questions are answered, navigate to the ""Generate Report"" section in the ""Introduction"" tab. This will then create a Microsoft Word document with all of the forecasts and answers embedded within, which can be downloaded and finalized before submitting to the instructor."
workflow4,"You can save your progress by downloading the user input before you leave the page (see ""Save your progress"" on this webpage for instructions on how to do this). This will allow you to return to this Shiny app and start from where you left off."

weather_forecast1,A weather forecast is probably the most widely used and applied forecast. Here we will examine the output from a weather forecast model from NOAA.
weather_forecast2,"Weather forecasts use multiple simulations from the same model, but alters the initial conditions of the model to generate different potential futures."
model1,"A model is a representation (physical, conceptual or mathematical) of a real ecological phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly (e.g., the abundance of foxes in a forest)."
model2,"Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship such as, ""warmer air temperature causes warmer lake surface temperature"" or ""a higher number of wolves leads to a lower population of deer""."
model3,"Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems."
mod_desc,The model we will be using in this module is the nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model. The nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model is a common tool in freshwater and marine research. The NP model represents the simplest sets of processes needed to model plankton dynamics.
phyto_chla,"Phytoplankton are primary producers. They take up nitrogen and other nutrients to photosynthesize (i.e., use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water). Chlorophyll-a is used as a proxy (i.e. indirect measurement) of the phytoplankton concentration in water. We will use chlorophyll-a  sensor measurements from the lake and assume the concentration of chlorophyll-a is equal to the concentration of phytoplankton for the purposes of this module."
ens_mod1,Ensemble modelling is using multiple simulations to predict an outcome and to reduce the error of the prediction.
uncertainty,Uncertainty emerges from some kind of error or imperfection in our knowledge and understanding of the ecological system being investigated.
uncert1,"Uncertainty comes from natural variability in the environment and imperfect knowledge of an ecological system. When generating a forecast, uncertainty can come from the structure of the model used, the conditions the model is initialized with, and the data used to drive the model, among other sources."
uncert2,"Uncertainty comes from natural variation and imperfect knowledge. For example, taking replicate samples is one way to estimate uncertainty in observations  whereas imperfect knowledge is reflected in our models, such as the NP model. This model, like many other ecological models, makes assumptions that we know are simplistic representations of reality. One such assumption is that phytoplankton nutrient uptake occurs at a constant parameter rate. It is known that many different species of phytoplankton take up nitrogen at different rates but to reduce model complexity one rate is assumed for all phytoplankton. In addition to process (model) uncertainty, observational uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty, other sources of uncertainty are drivers and initial conditions."
why_important,Knowing the uncertainty in a forecast allows forecast users to make informed decisions based on the potential future scenarios and prepare accordingly.
mod_selec_uc,Model selection uncertainty is due to not knowing which model best represents the variable you are predicting. It is often unaccounted for when only one model is used.
driver_uncert,"Driver uncertainty comes from in accuracies in the forecasted variables used to drive the model. The driver variable for our model is air temperature. To generate a forecast of future water temperature, we need to use forecasted driver data to drive the model."
proc_uc,Process uncertainty is uncertainty caused by our inability to model all processes as observed in the real world.
param_uncert,"Parameter uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in the model parameter values, which can be due to uncertainties in the data or the calibration process used."
init_uncert,Initial conditions uncertainty refers to uncertainty arising because the initial conditions are not precisely known or because the calculations cannot be performed with the precise initial conditions.
state_var,"State variables are those that give a snapshot of the system's properties at any single point in time. The phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration of an ecological model are examples of this. You can measure them, and you don't need any information about precisely how the system arrived in its current state."
parameter,A parameter is a value in a model that  describes the rate of change in those states.
fc_cycle_end,"We have now stepped through each of the steps in the forecast cycle. As you can see, forecasting is an iterative process. We constantly will need to generate forecasts of the future as time moves forward. When we combine our forecasts with data, we can use this data to update our model, which will then improve our model the more forecasts we make. This is one of the key advantages of ecological forecasting."

distribution,"A parameter distribution shows the possible values for a parameter value and how often they occur. For example, a normal distribution of a parameter has a bell-shaped curve, and the median is the most likely value of that parameter."
r_squared," is a goodness-of-fit measure for linear regression models. This statistic indicates the amount of variation in the dependent variable that the independent variable was able to correctly  explain. R-squared measures the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable on a convenient 0 to 1 scale, where 0 means that no variation in the independent variable is explained by the dependent variable, and 1 means that all variation in the independent variable is explained by the dependent variable."
density_plots,Density plots are used to observe the distribution of a variable in a dataset.
