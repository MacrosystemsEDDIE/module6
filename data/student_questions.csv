q1,Q1. What is meant by the term 'uncertainty' in the context of ecological forecasting?
q2,Q2. Why is uncertainty important when generating ecological forecasts?
q3,Q3. How do you think uncertainty helps natural resource managers when using a forecast? E.g. water resource manager using an algal bloom forecast.
q4,Q4. Fill out information about your selected NEON site:
q4a,a. Name of selected site:
q4b,b. Four letter site identifier:
q4c,c. Latitude:
q4d,d. Longitude:
q4e,e. Lake area (km2):
q4f,f. Elevation (m):
q9,"Q9. What is the relationship between each of these driving variables and productivity? For example, if the driving variable increases, will it cause productivity to increase (positive), decrease (negative), or have no effect (stay the same)."
q9a,a. Surface water temperature
q9b,b. Incoming light
q9c,c. Available nutrients
q10,Q10. Classify the following as either a state variable or a parameter by dragging it into the corresponding bin.
q11,Q11. We are using chlorophyll-a as a proxy of aquatic primary productivity. Select how you envision each parameter to affect chlorophyll-a concentrations:
q11a,a. Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton
q11b,b. Phytoplankton mortality
q12,Q12. Do you think there is a linear relationship between air temperature and water temperature?
q13,Q13. How does the amount of data used to calculate the linear regression affect the estimation of the parameters 'm' and 'b'?
q14,Q14. How did using less data to fit your model affect its overall performance?
q15,Q15. Which model performed best? Why do you think that is?
q16,Q16. Do you think you could use this model for a forecast? Why/why not?
q17,Q17. Which parameter (m or b) has a higher level of uncertainty? How can you tell?
q18,Q18. How does adjusting the number of samples affect the range of uncertainty?
q19,Q19. Regenerate the parameter distributions with high uncertainty for the slope (m) and low uncertainty for the intercept (b). How does the level of uncertainty change for air temperatures greater than 20 degC?
q20,Q20. Regenerate the parameter distributions with low uncertainty for the slope (m) and high uncertainty for the intercept (b). How does the level of uncertainty change for air temperatures less than 10 degC?
q21,Q21. Which interval has the largest error? Why do you think that is?
q22,Q22. What does the sign in front of the error tell you?
q23,Q23. Why do you think it is important to separate the data into an training and testing dataset?
q24,Q24. Save the model results with a 1-day lag for water temperature and air temperature into rows 1 and 2 in the data table respectively. Which model performed better? Why do you think that is?
q25.,Q25. Save the model results with a 3-day mean for water temperature and air temperature. Which model performed better? Why do you think that is?
q26,Q26. Define a hypothesis about which combination of variables and/or lag/mean number of days would provide the best model results and why?
q27,Q27. Fit the model you hypothesized in Q26 and save your model results into row 3 of the datatables. Did the model simulation match your hypothesis? How?/How not?
q28,Q28. Fit a model with a 5-day lag for water temperature and a 3-day mean for air temperature. Save your results in row 4.
q29,Q29. Fit a model with a 5-day lag for air temperature and a 3-day mean for water temperature. Save your results in row 5.
