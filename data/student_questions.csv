q1,Q1. What is meant by the term 'uncertainty' in the context of ecological forecasting?
q2,"Q2. How do you think knowing the uncertainty in a forecast helps natural resource managers? For example, if a drinking water manager received a toxic algal bloom forecast with high vs. low uncertainty in a bloom prediction, how might that affect their decision-making?"
q3,Q3. How do you think uncertainty helps natural resource managers when using a forecast? E.g. water resource manager using an algal bloom forecast.
q4,Q4. Fill out information about your selected NEON site:
q4a,a. Name of selected site:
q4b,b. Four letter site identifier:
q4c,c. Latitude:
q4d,d. Longitude:
q4e,e. Lake area (km2):
q4f,f. Elevation (m):
q5,Q5. List variables that show a seasonal cycle.
q6,Q6. Can you name a couple of reasons why they exhibit such patterns?
q7,Q7. List two potential impacts on lakes and inland water bodies as a result of increasing water temperature.
q8,Q8. Do you think there is a linear relationship between air temperature and water temperature at this lake?
q9,Q9. How does increasing the amount of data used affect the estimation of the linear regression?
q10,"Q10. When looking at the time series plot (across), which model performed best? Why do you think that is?"
q11,Q11. Do you think you could use any of these models for a forecast of water temperature? Why/why not?
q12,"Q12. Which model (Monthly, Fortnightly, Weekly or Daily) has the least amount of uncertainty? How can you tell?"
q18,"Q18. How does adjusting the number of samples affect the range of uncertainty in the model, as determined by the variation in the lines?"
q19,"Q19. Regenerate the parameter distributions with high uncertainty (large standard deviation) for the slope (m) and low uncertainty (small standard deviation) for the intercept (b) by adjusting the slider bars above. How does the level of uncertainty change for air temperatures greater than 20 degC, as measured by the range of the confidence intervals?"
q20,"Q20. Regenerate the parameter distributions with low uncertainty (small standard deviation) for the slope (m) and high uncertainty (large standard deviation) for the intercept (b) by adjusting the slider bars above. How does the level of uncertainty change for air temperatures less than 10 degC, as measured by the range of the confidence intervals?"
q21,Q21. Which interval has the largest error? Why do you think that is?
q22,Q22. What does the sign in front of the error tell you?
q23,Q23. Why do you think it is important to separate the data into an training and testing dataset?
q24,Q24. Save the model results with a 1-day lag for water temperature and air temperature into rows 1 and 2 in the data table respectively. Which model performed better? Why do you think that is?
q25.,Q25. Save the model results with a 3-day mean for water temperature and air temperature. Which model performed better? Why do you think that is?
q26,Q26. Define a hypothesis about which combination of variables and/or lag/mean number of days would provide the best model results and why?
q27,Q27. Fit the model you hypothesized in Q26 and save your model results into row 3 of the datatables. Did the model simulation match your hypothesis? How?/How not?
q28,Q28. Fit a model with a 5-day lag for water temperature and a 3-day mean for air temperature. Save your results in row 4.
q29,Q29. Fit a model with a 5-day lag for air temperature and a 3-day mean for water temperature. Save your results in row 5.
q30,Q30. What happened when you ran a forecast with model 1?
q31,Q31. How do your models compare to each other? Do they forecast similar values?
q32,Q32. How does process uncertainty propagate (e.g. how does it change further into the future)?
q50,"Q9. What is the relationship between each of these driving variables and productivity? For example, if the driving variable increases, will it cause productivity to increase (positive), decrease (negative), or have no effect (stay the same)."
q51,a. Surface water temperature
q52,b. Incoming light
q53,c. Available nutrients
q54,Q10. Classify the following as either a state variable or a parameter by dragging it into the corresponding bin.
q55,Q11. We are using chlorophyll-a as a proxy of aquatic primary productivity. Select how you envision each parameter to affect chlorophyll-a concentrations:
q56,a. Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton
q57,b. Phytoplankton mortality
