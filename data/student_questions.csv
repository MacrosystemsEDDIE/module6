q1,Q1. What is meant by the term 'uncertainty' in the context of ecological forecasting?
q2,"Q2. How do you think knowing the uncertainty in a forecast helps natural resource managers? For example, if a drinking water manager received a toxic algal bloom forecast with high vs. low uncertainty in a bloom prediction, how might that affect their decision-making?"
q3,Q3. How do you think uncertainty helps natural resource managers when using a forecast? E.g. water resource manager using an algal bloom forecast.
q4,Q4. Fill out information about your selected NEON site:
q4a,a. Name of selected site:
q4b,b. Four letter site identifier:
q4c,c. Latitude:
q4d,d. Longitude:
q4e,e. Lake area (km2):
q4f,f. Elevation (m):
q5,Q5. List variables that show a seasonal cycle.
q6,Q6. Can you name a couple of reasons why they exhibit such patterns?
q7,Q7. List two potential impacts on lakes and inland water bodies as a result of increasing water temperature.
q8,Q8. Do you think there is a linear relationship between air temperature and water temperature at this lake?
q9,Q9. How does increasing the amount of data used affect the estimation of the linear regression?
q10,"Q10. When looking at the time series plot (across), which model performed best? Why do you think that is?"
q11,Q11. Do you think you could use any of these models for a forecast of water temperature? Why/why not?
q12,"Q12. Which model (Monthly, Fortnightly, Weekly or Daily) has the least amount of uncertainty around its parameters (e.g. m and b)? How can you tell?"
q13,"Q13. How does adjusting the number of samples affect the range of uncertainty in the model, as determined by the variation in the lines?"
q14,"Q14. Regenerate the parameter distributions with high uncertainty (large standard deviation) for the slope (m) and low uncertainty (small standard deviation) for the intercept (b) by adjusting the slider bars above. How does the level of uncertainty change for air temperatures greater than 20 degC, as measured by the range of the confidence intervals?"
q15,"Q15. Regenerate the parameter distributions with low uncertainty (small standard deviation) for the slope (m) and high uncertainty (large standard deviation) for the intercept (b) by adjusting the slider bars above. How does the level of uncertainty change for air temperatures less than 10 degC, as measured by the range of the confidence intervals?"
q16,"Q16. Can you think of any limitations of using this model for forecasting? For example, forecasting more than one day into the future."
q17,Q17. Build a model that uses yesterday's water temperature as a predictor and fit the model parameters and add it to the first row in the table.How does the model match the observations? Are there any times where it is further from the observed water temperature?
q18,Q18. Build a model that uses yesterday's water temperature and today's air temperature as predictors and fit the model parameters and add it to the second row in the table.How does this model match the observations? Are there any times where it is further from the observed water temperature?
q19,Q19. Which model do you think will better predict water temperature? Why?
q20,Q20. Is there variation among your models? Why do you think that is?
q21,"Q21. Using the slider above, adjust the number of members and run the forecasts. How does forecast uncertainty change further into the future (e.g. with increasing forecast horizon)?."
q22,Q22. Which model is affected most by the addition of parameter uncertainty? Why do you think that is?
q23,Q23. Can you think of potential ways to reduce the amount (e.g. the quantity) of parameter uncertainty?
q24,Q24. Which model was most sensitive to initial conditions (e.g. had a large distribution of forecast members even after 7-days)? Why do you think that is?
q25,Q25. What factors can lead to an increase in initial conditions uncertainty?
q26,Q26. What potential steps could be taken to reduce initial conditions uncertainty?
q27,Q27. Which model was most sensitive to the forecast drivers (e.g. had a large distribution of forecast members even after 7-days)? Why do you think that is?
q28,Q28. Can you think of a way to reduce driver uncertainty in your forecast of water temperature?
