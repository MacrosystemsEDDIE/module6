q1,What is meant by the term 'uncertainty' in the context of ecological forecasting?,Introduction:
q2,"How do you think knowing the uncertainty in a forecast helps natural resource managers? For example, if a drinking water manager received a toxic algal bloom forecast with high vs. low uncertainty in a bloom prediction, how might that affect their decision-making?",Introduction:

q8,Do you think there is a relationship between air temperature and water temperature at this lake?,
q9,"Describe, in your own words, the difference between a linear regression model and a multiple linear regression model.",Activity A: Objective 3
q10,"Based on your exploration of water and air temperature data at your lake site in the previous objective, do you think it is reasonable to use air temperature as an independent variable in a model to predict water temperature? Why or why not?",Activity A: Objective 3
q11,"Based on the plot of observations and model predictions, do you think the persistence model does a good job of predicting model temperature? Why or why not?",Activity A: Objective 3
q12,Let's pretend a lake manager has asked you to provide a 30-day forecast of water temperature. Do you think a persistence model would be a good choice for generating such a forecast? Why or why not?,Activity A: Objective 3
q13,Does today's water temperature exhibit a positive or negative linear relationship with yesterday's water temperature?,Activity A: Objective 4
q14,Does today's water temperature exhibit a positive or negative linear relationship with today's air temperature?,Activity A: Objective 5
q15,"In a scatterplot of a perfect linear relationship, all the points fall exactly on the 1:1 line (see example figure to the right). Knowing this, assess the linear relationships between: 1) today's water temperature and yesterday's water temperature;  and 2) today's water temperature and today's air temperature. Which plot do you think exhibits a stronger linear relationship, and why?",Activity A: Objective 5
q16,"A positive linear regression model with a perfect fit has a slope (m = 1) and an intercept (b = 0). Knowing this, use the parameter values of your two linear regression models to assess the fit of: 1) the model using yesterday's water temperature to predict today's water temperature;  and 2) the module using today's air temperature and today's water temperature. Which model do you think exhibits a better fit, and why?",Activity A: Objective 5
q17,"Because both of our independent variables have the same units (degrees Celsius), we can compare the values of the coefficients to understand which independent variable has a stronger relationship with the dependent variable. Knowing this, is yesterday's water temperature or today's air temperature more strongly associated with today's water temperature?",Activity A: Objective 5
